The sample assignments below are designed to explore computation in the cellular-molecular realm. The first problem set explores how enzymes work in a biological system, and how the system can be reduced to mathematical equations that are useful for modeling. The second problem set illustrates how a biological system can be used to create an oscillating state.

Problem Set 1: Enzyme Kinetics ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/assignment1))  
Problem Set 2: The Repressilator ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/assignment2))
